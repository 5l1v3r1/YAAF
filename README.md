YAAF - Yet Another Admin Finder
===============================

ATTENTION
---------

This is just a project I made for learning experience. I'm not responsible for whatever you do with  
this software.


What is it?
-----------

This is a simple Admin Finder with many useful features.
Originally made in **Python 3.4**.

Features
--------

This python script offers **many** advantages:

- **Multi-threading** - It supports multi-threading from 1 thread to 10 threads.
- **Written in Python's last version** - Python2.7 is great because of the amount of libraries. But Python3.4 is the future!
- **Custom extensions** - You can add a custom extension, for example, `.php`. Every link it will try, will have `.php` added in the end.
- **Result logging** - If you want, you can save the results in `$HOME/.yaaf_output`.
- **User-Agent** - You can costumize the User-Agent you want to use.
- **Link Sanitize** - Many websites can have different request responses to different urls. So the `--sanitize` arg forces the link to appear like `example.com`.
- **Custom wordlists** - You can use a custom wordlist.  

For more information, just use the `--help` command.

Why?
----

I saw an Admin Finder in the [BlackArch](http://blackarch.org/) repositories ([link](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/112855/Admin-Page-Finder-Script.html)). I checked it's source and I thought it was too simplistic.  
So I thought about creating my own version of an Admin Finder script. It turned out to be something **much** better!
